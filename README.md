# Time tracker

## Important Note:

I am still addressing the Keycloak issue. I plan to build a custom Docker 
image for Keycloak to include the tt_realm_config.json file. It seems that 
the current and newer Keycloak Docker images are not importing the JSON realm 
configuration file correctly.

## Introduction

This is my time tracker web app, actually its backend part, developed in Java.
